Using the tsconfig file we can specify wich files we want to include or exclude in the compilation proccess.

-  **exclude**: will exclude files listed, you can use whitecards like `*` or `**/*` to indicate file patterns
-  **include**: will include files listed, you can use whitecards too.
-  **files**: use this option if you want to indicate files one by one.

[Example](tsconfig.json)
